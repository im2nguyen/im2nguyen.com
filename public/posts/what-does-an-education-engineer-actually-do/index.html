I currently help people [learn HashiCorp products](https://developer.hashicorp.com). Previously, I built engaging, interactive tutorials for [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) and [Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer), and managed the Consul Education team.  I also help advise [DreamsForSchools](https://www.dreamsforschools.org/) in designing computer science curriculums for elementary and middle school students across Southern California. 

Previously, I've led development teams in startups, and built internal DevOps tools at Optum."><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><meta name=robots content="all,follow"><meta name=googlebot content="index,follow,snippet,archive"><meta property="og:url" content="http://im2nguyen.com/posts/what-does-an-education-engineer-actually-do/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Tu's Thoughts"><meta property="og:title" content="What Does an Education Engineer Actually Do"><meta property="og:description" content="Over Thanksgiving, my family had questions about what I do at work.

They weren’t sure what an education engineer actually does.</p><p><img src=/img/education-engineer-comic.png alt="Do you code or teach? Yes. Comic"></p><p>At HashiCorp, education engineers design scenarios that emulate problems DevOps
engineers may run into and guide them through a solution. As part of the
Terraform Education team, these scenarios may come in the form of common use
cases, like how to <a href=https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/eks>spin up a Kubernetes cluster</a>
in your favorite cloud, or highlighting new features practitioners may find
useful, like <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/private-registry-add?in=terraform/modules">curating public providers and modules within Terraform Cloud</a>.
Since education engineers need to generate real world examples and their
solutions, they’re expected to have real experience and technical knowledge. If
you have prior experiences in advocating for and implementing <a href=https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/blue-green-canary-tests-deployments>blue-green deployments</a>,
you’re intimately aware of both the benefits and hurdles.</p><p>In the <a href=https://documentation.divio.com>&ldquo;grand unifying theory of documentation&rdquo;</a>,
education engineers help practitioners develop a mental model by creating
content that’s <a href=https://documentation.divio.com/tutorials/>learning</a> and
<a href=https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/>problem-orientated</a>. The
Terraform <a href=https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started>Get Started</a>
collections show users Terraform’s immediate value by having users provision,
modify and destroy a compute instance through code. Once users realize how to
use the product, they may navigate to content that covers the <a href=https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/use-case>specific use case</a>
they’re trying to address. By consuming content that’s learning and problem-orientated,
practitioners are better able to dive into and navigate the documentation to
solve their unique problems.</p><p><img src=/img/unified-theory-documentation.png alt="Grand unifying theory of documentation quadrant broken down into tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and reference"></p><p>While all of the content lives in our education platform, <a href=https://learn.hashicorp.com>Learn</a>, practitioners can engage with it in different ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tutorials.</strong> The majority of the content we create are tutorials, which
guide practitioners through a scenario. Most tutorials include a set of
commands and explanations that practitioners can copy and paste into their
terminal. We design the scenarios so that on completion, practitioners can
apply what they learned to a problem they’re facing. Tutorials serve as
our foundation — all additional content (e.g. interactive labs, workshops)
must stem from a tutorial. This gives practitioners an opportunity to
review and re-run sections they’re stuck with while running through the
lab or workshops.</p><p>We select new topics for tutorials from a combination of metrics that help
us assess whether a tutorial could be popular. This serves as an imperfect
proxy that measures whether users find the scenario both relevant and
engaging. For some tutorials, we work closely with engineers, product
managers, and other stakeholders to serve as the voice of the practitioner.
Finally, the team rigorously tests and reviews all tutorials — an average
tutorial review cycle has 100+ suggestions)!</p><p><img src=/img/learn-tutorial.png alt="Example Learn tutorial page with command snippet"></p></li><li><p><strong>Interactive Labs.</strong> For some tutorials, we create interactive labs with
<a href=https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp-learn>Instruqt</a> and then embed these
labs into our tutorials. This enables practitioners to experiment with
HashiCorp product features without having to install any dependencies.</p><p><img src=/img/embedded-instruqt-learn.png alt="Example Learn tutorial page with embedded lab"></p></li><li><p><strong>Workshops.</strong> During HashiConf, HashiCorp main conferences, the education
team hosts hands-on workshops. In these workshops, we guide practitioners
through interactive labs while answering questions they may have about the
feature/product or the scenario itself.</p></li></ol><p>During HashiConf Global 2021, we guided attendees through building a golden
image pipeline with HCP Packer, a new HashiCorp product offering that was
announced the day prior. By offering a workshop shortly after the product
launch, we were able to effectively get users to try the product.</p><p>In addition to the content on Learn, as an education engineer, we’re encouraged
to work on problems that the community struggles with. While working with
Terraform, I noticed that it was difficult to quickly get a graphical overview
of changes. This is especially important if you’re managing a large number of
resources, cross multiple regions and providers. When I proposed a visualizer
solution that could address this concern, my manager, Judith, encouraged me to
work on it even though it wouldn’t directly increase the number of visitors to
Learn. When I shipped the <a href=https://github.com/im2nguyen/rover>first version</a>,
Kerim, a developer advocate, encouraged me to speak about my experiences
building it during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIwZ6XEeCAo">HashiTalks: Build</a>.
Rover wouldn’t exist without their support and encouragement.</p><p>If this experience resonates with you and you enjoy working with amazing people,
the <a href=https://www.hashicorp.com/jobs/developer-relations>HashiCorp Education team is hiring</a>!
